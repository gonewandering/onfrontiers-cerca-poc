    "reasons_against_current_doc_search": "- No explicit indication of direct work with CISA or in similar federal agency cybersecurity projects.\n- No mention of recent or specific experience with the targeted cybersecurity tools or program areas such as identity and access management, endpoint detection, or IoT.\n- Unclear if the person was an employee or a contractor in relevant roles, which is important for this assessment.\n- The focus appears to be more on policy and strategic cybersecurity rather than hands-on technical implementation or program management directly within a federal agency.\n- Limited details about recent project management or operational support roles in similar complex federal cybersecurity initiatives.\n\n**Conclusion**: The candidate is strong in cybersecurity knowledge and policy but lacks demonstrated direct experience with CISA's specific organizational context, recent program delivery, or agency-specific operational support that would warrant a perfect match.

Serve as the lead counsel for Cummins Electronics and Fuel System and is a member of its leadership team. Also, served as a member of the IP legal team handing all facets of intellectual property and complex commercial transactions, including advising on patent and trademark prosecution, enforcement and licensing, copyright licensing, IP settlements, branding, software licensing, technology development and evaluation, and providing guidance on technical publication, and general guidance on IP considerations within all stages of the business cycle.\n\nChief Intellectual Property Counsel at Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (2017-10-01 - 2019-06-30)\nEstablish an intellectual property legal practice for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and serve as the intellectual property subject matter expert for and on behalf of CISA. Coordinate with the Office of the General Counsel's Intellectual Property Group to ensure coordinated approach on intellectual property policies, procedures and practices within the Department of Homeland Security.

Liaise with the Department of Justice on intellectual property litigation in which CISA employee is government witness or CISA has equities. Prepare and conduct intellectual property training for attorney managers and CISA officials.\n\nSupervisory Attorney Advisor, Intellectual Property at Department of Homeland Security (2008-08-01 - 2017-10-31)\nAt DHS, I was given the opportunity to establish a new legal practice within the Office of General Counsel specializing in intellectual property, Internet, and technology law. In setting up the practice, I partnered with the Department of Energy and Federal Aviation Administration to obtain supplemental patent prosecution services; collaborated in setting up an Invention Evaluation Board to review inventions in which the Department of Homeland Security had the option to pursue filing patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office; set up and matured a trademark practice allowing DHS to protect the names and visual identities associated with external facing programs; drafted and obtained consensus on DHS intellectual property policy; and implemented trademark and copyright policy and guidelines department-wide.\n\nAttorney Advisor, Legislative Affairs Division at Department of Homeland Security (2006-03-01 - 2008-08-31)\nBecause of my strong writing skills and work ethic, I was selected by the General Counsel of DHS to conduct research and provide a recommendation on two significant legal questions: one related to a Customs and Border Protection administrative decision that overturned a three-decade precedent on the “first sale rule” for assessment of tariffs. The change of practice by the Customs and Border Protection led to an uprising in the import/export industry and high scrutiny from Congress; the second related to revisions to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the procedures for permitting the United States Government to conduct surveillance for prevention of terrorism purposes. There was significant litigation against the United States pertaining to the law and high public interest in the authorities granted to the United States Government. My assignment prepared the recommendation memorandum provided to the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n\nStaff Attorney at Verizon Entertainment Services Company (2000-04-01 - 2003-07-31)\nAt this and another Verizon subsidiary, I assisted and supported the Office of the General Counsel, which comprised of 2 attorneys at the time.  I practiced intellectual property, telecommunications, Internet, and technology law. I negotiated, drafted and reviewed the Company’s contracts including, but not limited to, the following subject matters: Alliance, affiliate, access, consulting, content acquisition, encoding, patent licensing, master data processing, marketing, purchase, sales agency, general services, software licensing services, right of entry, leases, statements of work, and project management agreements.    Due to the merger between the former Bell Atlantic Corporation and GTE Communications Corporation, which necessitated restructuring to avoid business duplication, I was involved in winding down activities in preparation of full divestiture resulting from the merger.  Such activities included, but were not limited to, conducting due diligence, accessing liability and compliance with termination provisions of the Company’s major contracts, and assisting the General Counsel with litigation that had resulted from contract terminations and disposition of the Company’s major assets.\n\nAttorney at George Washington University – Office of VP and General Counsel (1999-10-01 - 2000-04-30)\nThe Office of the Vice President and General Counsel was looking for someone to manage the University and Medical Center’s Year 2000 compliance. It was a daunting undertaking it its breath and scope, but I successfully created documentation books cataloging the efforts, progress, and success of the University and Medical Center in becoming Year 2000 Ready. I supervised and delegated duties to assistants to accomplish this. As a result of the precision and skill with which I attacked the Year 2000 compliant project, I was assigned some other significant undertakings, including managing the due diligence for the corporate restructuring of an unincorporated University entity; identifying, retrieving, and reviewing existing vendor contracts, along with regulatory certificates and licenses required to operate two health care facilities; and drafting uniform contracting protocol guidelines accessible to University employees online. In a show of supreme confidence in my abilities, I was included on a team with senior attorneys in which we drafted, filed, and obtained community approval of off-site campus plan and drafted a settlement agreement for $4M fee dispute.\n\nAttorney at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom L.L.P. and Mobile Business Resources Corporation (1998-05-01 - 1999-10-31)\nIn this position, I along with a group of contract attorneys assisted Skadden attorneys with two separate Department of Justice (DOJ) Second Requests regarding merger of software companies and assisted Mobile attorneys with response to Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Second Request regarding Mobil/Exxon merger. I also reviewed and analyzed voluminous number of documents and categorized documents as privileged, responsive to DOJ or FTC specifications, or non-responsive; indexed, organized, and produced documents to DOJ and FTC.\n\nAttorney at Hogan Lovells (1997-05-01 - 1998-05-31)\nThis was my first position after graduating from law school with an interest and desire to practice intellectual property law. Instead, there was a need in the Project Finance satellite office of the firm and I welcomed the opportunity to practice law. My first assignment was about the deregulation of the electric power industry and I wrote informational memoranda for partners about that subject. I also drafted corporate restructuring contracts, which allowed power marketers to exercise FERC newly granted rights to compete in the electric power industry. Showing acumen for the subject, coupled with limited staff at the satellite office, my role in the projects increased exponentially.   I was given responsibility for drafting contracts and related documentation in conformity with the firm’s role as Bond Counsel for the Washington Airports Public Authority in the sale of public authority bonds for improvement and repair of the Washington airports; drafting contracts and related documents required as counsel for a private not-for-profit corporation acquiring a retirement community;\n\nKeywords:  administrative law,  federal government,  government contracts,  homeland security,  intellectual property,  leadership,  legal research,  legal writing,  licensing,  national security,  policy analysis,  public administration,  transactional law, corporate governance, mergers & acquisitions (m&a), policy\n\nCV TEXT:\n\nNo CV available for this profile.",

This multiple-award, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) firm-fixed-price contract will provide comprehensive worldwide expeditionary logistics and support services for Region 27, which encompasses the United States and Outlying Territories. The contract covers an extensive range of services including base operations, life support, construction equipment, medical services, force protection, communications, logistics, transportation, and supply provisions across multiple service categories. Only U.S.-based companies that are incorporated and directly controlled within the United States are eligible, and contractors must maintain a \"Basic Assessment\" in accordance with DFARS cybersecurity requirements. The government will evaluate proposals using a phased approach, first reviewing current WEXMAC incumbents, then large businesses, and finally small businesses, with evaluation based on responsibility determination and compliance rather than price. Questions were due by July 18, 2025, at 1000 Eastern Time, and proposals must be submitted by August 8, 2025, at 1000 Eastern Time.\n\nThis solicitation does not utilize any set-aside designations and is open to both large and small businesses, though current WEXMAC incumbents will receive priority consideration during the evaluation process. The contract carries a maximum value of $20 billion over the contract period, with $10 billion allocated for the base period and $10 billion for the option period, spanning from August 15, 2025, through December 31, 2030.

This multiple-award, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) firm-fixed-price contract will provide comprehensive worldwide expeditionary logistics and support services for Region 27, which encompasses the United States and Outlying Territories. The contract covers an extensive range of services including base operations, life support, construction equipment, medical services, force protection, communications, logistics, transportation, and supply provisions across multiple service categories. Only U.S.-based companies that are incorporated and directly controlled within the United States are eligible, and contractors must maintain a \"Basic Assessment\" in accordance with DFARS cybersecurity requirements. The government will evaluate proposals using a phased approach, first reviewing current WEXMAC incumbents, then large businesses, and finally small businesses, with evaluation based on responsibility determination and compliance rather than price. Questions were due by July 18, 2025, at 1000 Eastern Time, and proposals must be submitted by August 8, 2025, at 1000 Eastern Time.\n\nThis solicitation does not utilize any set-aside designations and is open to both large and small businesses, though current WEXMAC incumbents will receive priority consideration during the evaluation process. The contract carries a maximum value of $20 billion over the contract period, with $10 billion allocated for the base period and $10 billion for the option period, spanning from August 15, 2025, through December 31, 2030.

Before my time at MARAD I spent 22 years working in the U.S. Department of Defense as both an acquisition professional and U.S. Navy Supply Corps officer.\n\nEducation:\n- Bachelor's degree,  at Dordt University (Ended: 2000-06-30)\n- ,  at University of Virginia's Darden School of Business and Resource Management Program (Ended: 2006-03-01)\n- Bachelor's of Arts degree, History at Dordt University (Ended: 2000-05-01)\n\nWork Experience:\n\nSenior Contracts Manager at Nakupuna Companies (2025-03-01 - None)\n\nContracting Team Lead/Contracting Officer at Federal Aviation Administration HQ (None - None)\n(GS-14 equivalent)\n40+ hours per week\nSupervisor: Mr. Patrick Weare, 202-267-5483, Patrick.Weare@faa.gov\n\nAs a senior contracting officer and team lead assigned to FAA's Surveillance Branch (AAQ-210) I am overall\nresponsible for over $12B of surveillance broadcast services (SBS) contracts and procurements including the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) contract. This major service contract is valued at over $2B and provides critical safety and operational efficiencies for the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). My duties\ninclude close coordination with the program management office (PMO), the contractor, the Department of\nDefense, and various internal stakeholders in administering the ADS-B contract. As the contracting officer I lead a\nteam of four contract specialist support personnel, three contracting officer's representatives (CORs), and one\nfederal contract specialist and provide training, oversight, and direction in the performance of their duties. I\nprovide daily training and oversight for both contracting and program management personnel as the team\ncontinues to refine and improve its processes. I led these teams in the drafting, chief financial officer (CFO)\napproval, and release of the solicitation for the follow-on ADS-B contract with the incumbent. I also created the negotiation strategy to be used with the incumbent based on lessons learned and collaboration with fellow FAA\ncontracting officers. I created, and am negotiating, a strategy by which the ADS-B network will migrate off time\ndivision multiplexing (TDM) technology in an orderly manner that represents the best value to the FAA. I initiated\nand led the first-ever conformed copy of the current contract, and a reconciliation of contract value at the modification and contract line item (CLIN) level. I established, and lead, a team of FAA experts in technical\ninterchange meetings with several space-based ADS-B vendors in an effort to gauge industry's willingness and\nability to establish a future competitive procurement for ADS-B. I am the first contracting officer in the history of this team to provide leadership, direction, and overall responsibility, for a multibillion-dollar ADS-B contract while\npreparing for, and leading, negotiations on a single-source follow-on ADS-B contract with an estimated award value of several billions of dollars. Finally, I am a member of the four-person baseline surveillance future segment (BSFS)\nleadership team and ensure that the program office, contracting office, and legal counsel are closely aligned.\n\n\nIn addition to my duties as the ADS-B contracting officer I am also the contracting officer assigned to the FAA's\nAirspace Non-Cooperative Surveillance Radar (ANSR) program. I am currently working with the program office on\npotential acquisition strategies for this next generation of NAS-wide radar with a potential estimated procurement\nvalue in excess of $5B.\n\nMy contributions to the FAA go beyond my team, program, and division. I helped establish and lead a forum of FAA contracting officers who share the same prime vendor in an effort to understand what drives the vendor's\nbusiness behaviors so as to increase FAA's buying power. I conduct weekly mentoring sessions with junior\ncontracting personnel outside my team and established a monthly FAA contract specialist off-site social hour, to increase the skills, camaraderie, morale, and teamwork within FAA's contracting community.\n\nI received an in-position increase (IPI), the FAA's equivalent of a quality step increase (QSI), in June of 2024 for my\nexemplary contributions to FAA acquisition workforce and was the graduation speaker of my cohort for the\n\nContracting Officer at Federal Aviation Administration (2023-09-01 - 2025-03-31)\n\nContract Specialist at Federal Aviation Administration (2023-06-01 - 2023-09-30)\n\nContract Team Lead at U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration (2022-08-01 - 2023-06-01)\nAcquisition support for the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy\n\nFederal Energy Contracts and Clean Power Procurement Specialist at Energy the Department of Energy's Federal Energy and Water Management Program (2017-01-01 - 2017-01-01)\nDLA Energy again earned the FEMP Contracting Award in 2021 as a direct result of my work in soliciting and awarding the federal government's first-ever liquefied natural gas supply and delivery contract in support of Naval\nStation Guantanamo Bay.

I was overall\nresponsible for a wide range of procurements including information technology, human resources, capital\nimprovements, utilities, and all other requirements of a prestigious military academy. My team solicited, awarded,\nadministered, and closed out contracts using small and large businesses, including 8(a) vendors, and utilizing FAR\nPart 8 procedures with GSA as well as open market procurements. From small, firm-fixed price awards to multimillion\ndollar fixed-price incentive type contracts I led my team in utilizing a vast array of acquisition strategies and source selection procedures. With over 75 active procurements in excess of $30 million my position required\nleadership, coordination and communication with multiple stakeholders, proactive and reactive management\nskills, and a thorough understanding of federal acquisition procedures. USMMA requirements have congressional\nlevel interest with capital improvements briefed to Congress on a regular basis. I was actively engaged in training both my team members as well as the customers and program office in acquisition best practices. My leadership,\ninitiative, and acquisition experience had a direct, positive impact on all aspects of USMMA and ports and\ninfrastructure support. As a result of my work at MARAD I earned the Department of Transportation (DOT)\nSecretary's Partnering in Excellence Award.\n\nSupervisory Contracting Officer and Contract Specialist GS-13 at Defense Logistics Agency Energy (None - None)\n40 hours per week\nSupervisor: Mr. Scott Taetsch, scott.taetsch@dla.mil,\nAs a supervisory contracting officer at DLA Energy I was responsible for awarding and overseeing the administration\nof fixed-price with economic price adjustment (FPEPA) contracts for direct supply natural gas to Department of Defense and federal civilian facilities in the United States south region. I led and supervised a team of 5 contract\nspecialists administering 11 contracts with an estimated award value of $92,997,774. Administration of these\ncontracts involved various post-award issues including renegotiation of awarded prices due to changed\nrequirements and weather-driven circumstances affecting the natural gas industry. In an effort to broaden DLA\nEnergy's customer base I initiated a smaller procurement that resulted in four new customers with a total estimated\ncontract value of $3,909,624. This procurement utilized both the streamlined acquisition procedures and the test\nprogram for certain commercial items as set forth in FAR parts 12.6 and 13.5. Use of these procedures resulted in a\n19% reduction in procurement administrative lead time (PALT). Identifying future needs for direct supply natural gas\n\n\nfor 60 customers in the U.S. south region I initiated a procurement for an estimated $147,328,326. Working closely with the customer account specialists in the business unit I laid the groundwork for carefully identifying unique\naspects of each customer's natural gas requirement.\n\nAs a contract specialist with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Energy I performed both pre- and post- award\nefforts in the renewable and resilient energy sectors as well as liquefied natural gas. I researched, solicited,\nassisted in the award of, and administered over $700,000,000 of renewable, resilient, and clean energy contracts\nfor the Department of Defense of up to 28 years in term. I led source selection teams in evaluation and award of\nthese efforts and led post-award administration teams that included multiple services, support agencies and\ncontractors, and other government departments like the Department of Energy.

As the lead Contract Specialist for this Fixed-Price Incentive-Fee contract I\nled fact-finding sessions with the contractor, conducted cost and price analysis of the contractor's proposal, and wrote the pre-negotiation business clearance in preparation for negotiations. These efforts required numerous\nmeetings and close coordination with the contractor, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and the\nDefense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). My other assignments at NAVSEA included contract administration of the Cost-Plus Award Fee contract for the Next Generation Destroyer (DDG-1000). My duties for the DDG-1000\nprogram included both pre-award and post-award contract actions. Specifically, I assisted in writing the\nacquisition strategy and synopsized requirements for the third ship of this three-ship class. In administering the\nDDG-1000 contract I negotiated modifications valued at $121,191,330 to incorporate various changes into the contract. These actions required price and cost analysis to document both pre-negotiation and post-negotiation\nbusiness clearances.

Authored, reviewed, and validated program funding, logistics and supply chain requirements, and ACC supplements to higher-level AF policy.  Interagency Alliances & Negotiating: Challenged by senior officials to develop comprehensive strategy for positioning F-35 Joint Strike Fighter at bases around the world. Assembled a team of aircraft logistics experts and partnered with key representatives from Eglin Air Force Base, which was conducting initial F-35 training for pilots and maintenance personnel. Directed the identification of and negotiation for all maintenance and logistics requirements, shaping the human capital plans and career fields assigned to the F-35 platform. The ANG civil engineering community pushed back against the need for certain types of parking spaces and simulator facilities for the F-35. Realizing they simply lacked key knowledge regarding classified side of the F-35 program, sought common ground in order to mitigate any distracting politics or \nGREG JOHNSON 5 competing priorities and focus the group on shared interests. Tactfully explained program requirements and gained the needed support. As a result, all required personnel at four key bases were trained and ready, and the first ANG base accepted two F-35 aircraft in August 2019.  Selected Accomplishments and Key Results:  § As a recognized SME for low-observable material (LOM) concurrent maintenance, led familiarization tours of the First Fighter Wing LOM facilities to educate and train the workforce. As a result of newfound knowledge, two units achieved a 40% increase in maintenance scheduling effectiveness and a 25% increase in aircraft availability.  § Directed an initiative to resolve concerns about the reliability of oxygen regulators installed on the F-15 fleet after a fatal accident in the summer of 2014. Worked with depot engineers and AF Safety Center to determine serviceability of all regulators.

Additional Professional Experience:    2011–2013, Deputy Maintenance Group Commander, 162nd Fighter Wing, Tucson AZ: Led a diverse maintenance workforce of 400+ technicians in 12 specialties, while consistently ensuring that enough aircraft were available to meet operational flying requirements (highest among 90 flying wings) for 60+ sorties per day. Maintained munitions stockpiles to military standards, including associated support equipment and trailers used to transport weapons. Drove improvements to maintenance scheduling, which increased effectiveness from 81% in 2010 to 98% in 2011 and dramatically reduced rescheduling of work.  2009–2010, Division Chief Programs and Manpower, Logistics Manpower and Requirements, National Guard Bureau (NGB/A4P): Planned and managed a $3.5B budget to sustain over 1.5K aircraft, 49K logistics personnel, 21.5K pieces of equipment, and a fleet of 15K vehicles located at more than 250 units across the nation. When the ANG Readiness Center began running out of Military Personnel Appropriation (MPA) days to complete critical logistics inspections, directed each Functional Area Manager to identify potential cuts, then prioritized the reductions and established a cut line/threshold.

Cloverland Electric Cooperative was founded in 1938. Prior to 1936, much of rural america was without electricity. In fact, it wasn’t until the passage of the Rural Electrification Act, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal, that electricity would begin its move into America’s rural countryside. Electric cooperatives were organized to provide this service and make the dream of electricity on the farm a reality.   When the lines were originally energized, Cloverland brought power to 1,090 co-op members. Today, the company serves 42,000 accounts, including electric service to more islands than any other cooperative in the nation.  In 2010, the cooperative doubled in size through the acquisition of Edison Sault Electric Company. Cloverland now maintains local control of the hydroelectric plant in Sault Ste. Marie. From 1910-1963, the plant was used to generate electricity for the Union Carbide complex located on that property. In 1963, Union Carbide decided to sell the complex, providing an opportunity for Edison Sault to purchase the facility and convert it into one capable of producing electricity for consumers in the area. The plant was purchased by Edison Sault in 1963.

Critical to supporting the Army of 2030 and pivoting to the Army of 2040 is a less complex network that can support large-scale combat operations by enabling formation mobility, providing assured voice communications, a data-enabled common operating picture and digital fires and resist cyber and electronic warfare attacks.  To advance this capability for the Army of 2030, PEO C3N is fielding modernized network communications gear; mission command and cyber understanding applications; network management tools; integrated command posts; network initialization capability and communications security technology to brigades and division enablers. In 2023 alone, more than 400 Army, Army Reserve and Army National Guard formations will be fielded with modernized network and mission command application technology.  At the same time, we are planning to deliver additional technology improvements in FY25, including delivery of mobile command posts; more resilient network connectivity; unified network operations tools; mission command visualization; and data management tools across the division formation.  As we design the network to enable the Army of 2030, rigorous acquisition practices, industry and S&T alignment, and engineering framework underpinning design and delivery will remain in place. There will still be frequent opportunities for industry to integrate advanced capabilities into the Army network design process.  We will continue to leverage persistent experimentation and Soldier feedback, including from ongoing operations, exercises, and units fielded with modernized capabilities, to inform the network of 2030 design.\n\nLead Electronic Warfare & Cyber Author / Systems Engineer at PEO IEW&S (2018-03-01 -

The procurement seeks contractors to deliver secure, modern IT enterprise services including program management, technical expertise, strategic IT planning, lifecycle logistics sustainment, and systems engineering support for critical capabilities such as Enterprise Access Management Services, Multi-Factor Authentication, Identity Governance & Administration, and Privileged Access Management. Contractors must demonstrate experience with DoD and PEO C3N environments, possess or obtain SECRET-level facility clearance, and have the capability to support network modernization and Zero Trust Architecture Framework implementation. The RFI requires responses to address eight specific questionnaire items covering past performance, technical understanding, staffing approaches, and subcontracting management plans. All responses must be submitted electronically by August 1, 2025, at 1700 EST, with a 10-page maximum limit.\n\nThe procurement has no set-aside designation currently, though all small business set-aside categories will be considered based on RFI responses, with the requirement that small business primes must perform at least 50% of the work themselves under any small business set-aside. The incumbent contractor is identified as Chenega under contract W52P1J-21-D-0018, and the E-ICAM program was recently transitioned from PEO Enterprise Information Systems to PEO C3N in October 2023. The estimated contract period consists of a 12-month base period and four 12-month option periods for a total of five years, with performance commencing on January 30, 2026.

When first joining industry after his early career government service, he supported a strategic winning multi-$B proposal, and has continuously been an active BD contributor ever since. Beyond his capture/proposal capabilities, he offers experience in orals coaching, contract transitions, and small business planning. He has supported domestic bids to NASA, the DoD, the Intelligence Community, and many other Federal civilian agencies. He also has significant international experience. For both small and large businesses, he has been successful in building, leading, and motivating capture and proposal teams to meet business winning goals - delivering strategic growth. His immersive engagement style features frank open communications. He presents an unwavering focus on winning.

Bid was for a multi-vessel production role for delivery of ship modules for up to 10 vessels.  The contract being pursued was a Foreign Military Finance (FMF) contract – with a set of stringent FMS-based procurement and financial regulations that needed to be complied with.  I led every aspect of proposal development to include writing much of the management and technical volumes.  I \nDoug Tighe, PhD, CEng(UK), FIET(UK), 12 North Egremont Road, Alford, MA 01230 doug@tighe.org, 703-350-1108 cell \n  3 derived a Past Performance strategy based on the client’s three most recent DoD related vessels (Littoral Combat Ship, Constellation class Frigate, and Response Moat-Medium). Also, led the development of more than a dozen plans (such as PMP, Risk Management, Quality, Security, etc.) that were proposal deliverables.  Total contract value far exceeded $1B. Following proposal submittal, received three very minor ENs, and then my client was invited to open discussions on award of contract. ¨ For X-Bow Launch Systems served as Proposal Manager on their bid to win the Large Solid Propellant Rocket Motor Development Program – enabling a significant future second source production contract opportunity supporting the Army’s and Navy’s hypersonic missile programs.  Led proposal administrative processes while also contributing to overall win strategy.  Proposed solution delivered extraordinary cost reductions – meeting the Government’s primary objective for this second source procurement. Proposal was called “the best that X-Bow has ever submitted” by X-Bow’s CEO.  Proposal was delivered one day early. ¨ For AT&T Government Solutions served as Capture Manager on AT&T’s winning proposal to secure a 15-year role on GSA’s next generation Federal agency telecom/IT services IDIQ vehicle – Enterprise Infrastructure Solutions (EIS). Filled in as an external consultant following a progression of several internal capture managers – who either resigned or were fired - for this corporate focus/must win program. Worked as a Proposal Content Strategist & Reviewer within a leadership triad that included AT&T’s internal Proposal Manager and Program Manager. Restructured the content of the Technical Volume to improve quality and resolve a major page count issue. Following Red Team, rewrote the introductory section of the Price Volume. Led all internal capture efforts from the draft RFP phase, through receipt of the final RFP, and numerous amendments, leading to the submittal of a superior proposal defining and pricing more than several dozen domestic and global telecom/IT infrastructure services – including voice, data, cloud services, and satellite communications. Provided leadership and worked extensively with the internal Program Manager, Associate Vice President of BD and Proposal Manager to address compliance, compelling content, win strategy, executive summary and price volume estimation rationale which supported and justified a largely commodity-based price position representing an ~$8B business case during EIS’s first 5-year period of performance. Led, optimized, and managed a Shipley team consisting of almost two dozen proposal specialists. ¨ For Lockheed Martin Space Operations served as Capture Strategist, Proposal Manager, and (for 5 years) Program Manager, for the $3.4B NASA Consolidated Space Operations Contract (CSOC). CSOC was a new ops & services contract which consolidated 18 existing space operations contracts across most of NASA’s centers and field locations into a single master contract. CSOC supported JSC, MSFC, KSC, GSFC, JPL, Wallops Island, the complete TDRSS Space Network (Las Cruces and Guam), the globally distributed set of several dozen TT&C ground stations in the Ground Network, JPL’s Deep Space Network, and the NASA WAN (providing voice, data for all of NASA) between each center’s/site’s point of presence. CSOC did not provide WAN services internal to each location. CSOC provided a wide range of space operations services including mission control, agency-wide logistics, IT, TT&C support, data and voice communications, launch services, system integration/SETA, and future system technology/service enhancements.   CSOC’s goal was continued service excellence while reducing NASA’s space operations costs by ~$2B over 10 years. CSOC was a CPAF contract, and during its 5th year, as PM I achieved a 100% award fee – almost unheard of for NASA. At the start of CSOC, I managed the execution of a complex 60 day transition from the 18 existing space operations contracts to the single CSOC contract vehicle. During the proposal, I was the principal author of CSOC’s Transition Plan, which was delivered and evaluated.  CSOC had a very challenging 1st tier Small Business goal of 26%. During contract performance, I established a beneficial working relationship with the SB Liaison Office at NASA HQs, and also met quarterly with NASA’s Minority Business Relations Advisory Committee (MBRAC). By the end of its 5th year, CSOC had saved NASA ~$1B in cost, and generated ~$850M in contract change orders for Lockheed Martin.  My involvement in CSOC started following a failed internal corporate Red Team. I was asked to serve as a new Proposal Manager to recover the proposal to a winning state. I served as Proposal Manager for the final 12 months prior to submittal, and worked closely with LM’s Capture Manager, Ken Asbury (who has recently served as CACI CEO). I improved capture/proposal team morale and performance and led the creation of a winning proposal. Lockheed Martin won the strategic CSOC program in a tough competition with Boeing. I managed a proposal team of more than 100 participants representing approximately 6 large businesses and over two dozen small businesses. Following our win, I served as Program Manager for CSOC for 5 years routinely dealing with NASA HQs, five of NASA’s major centers, the Wallops Island Test Facility, the US-based node of JPL’s Deep Space Network, NASA’s complete domestic logistics infrastructure (which CSOC managed), and the domestic and global ground infrastructure for NASA’s TDRSS. \nDoug Tighe, PhD, CEng(UK), FIET(UK), 12 North Egremont Road, Alford, MA 01230 doug@tighe.org, 703-350-1108 cell \n  4 ¨ For Raven Industries, over an interval of 16 months, served as Capture Manager and Proposal Manager for its bid to win the US Geological Survey’s $300M IDIQ Technical Support Services Contract (TSSC). High quality proposal, priced just below derived PTW, was submitted in early March 2020. TSSC provides a range of technical services, in a task order and performance-based IDIQ environment, for the USGS EROS Center in Sioux Falls, SD. EROS hosts the largest Earth observing data base in the world and also serves as the down-link ground station for NASA’s Landsat mission. Client engagement also featured a secondary charter to embed enhanced business development capabilities into its business culture. RFP placed emphasis on four technical sample task orders, 60-day transition from incumbent contractor, innovation across technical and management and application of emerging new technologies (AI, ML, cloud services, HPC, and others). TSSC PWS defined five areas of technical support – science, data and information, engineering, satellite ground systems, and data center O&M. ¨ For Northrop Grumman Defense Systems, served as Proposal Manager and Capture Strategist providing support to NG’s internal capture manager in its pursuit to win the recompete of its Mobility Air Forces Distributed Mission Operations (MAF DMO) contract.  MAF DMO was a task order proposal within the existing TSA III master IDIQ. MAF DMO provided complex near-real time network-based distributed training to the USAF’s mobility air forces pilots/navigators. The MAF DMO network was mostly domestic, but also featured the participation of several coalition partner countries. Derived technical and management win strategy. Performed detailed analysis of contract Statement of Objectives and Performance Work Statement. Created and matured a set of candidate proposal evaluation ‘strengths’ with each defining Customer benefit supported by proof points. Developed a detailed RFP shaping strategy featuring more than a dozen well supported recommendations on RFP content that was presented and discussed with key source selection personnel. Planned and led efforts to produce an early narrative-based proposal to be internally reviewed using a Pink Team review approach. Provided similar support to other internal capture managers on other USAF contract targets including Warfighter Readiness and Training, Cybersecurity Support, Warfare Analysis Engineering and Technical Support Services, and Cyber Center of Excellence /Regional Signal Training Center. During the USAF’s source selection process, I earned the highest possible technical/management evaluation rating of Blue (Outstanding) and the best possible performance risk assessment of high confidence. Unfortunately, NG DS was underbid significantly by a competitor, and despite the high bar set by the technical/performance content and low performance risk, the USAFs best value determination strongly factored in bottom line price for this FFP contract – leading to a NG DS loss. ¨ For Peraton, served as Win Strategist and Volume Lead for the management content in the Mission Suitability Volume supporting Peraton’s winning incumbent recompete proposal for the $2B NASA Goddard Space Flight Center’s Space Exploration Networks Services and Evolution (SENSE) contract. SENSE deals with O&M, sustainment and future development for NASA’s Space Network (the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System – TDRSS), global TT&C Ground Network, and Space Geodesy Networks. Provided on-going input into Peraton’s capture strategy and concurrently supported the creation of the overall Mission Suitability Volume – including serving as lead author for the Transition Plan deliverable. ¨ For General Dynamics AIS and BAE Systems IT as Capture Strategist for the $1B Patriot proposal to the NRO’s Communications Directorate dealing with the consolidation of three legacy contracts supporting upgrades, O&M and sustainment for CONUS and OCONUS IT services, voice and data networks. Capture support was provided while I concurrently served as Program Manager for GD AIS’s Communications, Operations, and Maintenance Services (COMS) contract. Earned award fees never below 95% and delivered a ROS for COMS that was consistently at or above 15%. COMS provided desktop, voice, and data network services to the NRO’s domestic classified network. ¨ For United Technologies Aerospace Systems, provided consulting support as Capture Manager, and served as Proposal Manager for a ~400 page unsolicited $2B Next Generation Spacesuit Development and Sustainment White Paper proposal to NASA, which utilized existing spacesuit sustainment and development options on UTAS’ existing EMOC contract. Much of the White Paper’s content was included in the recent full and open NASA competition for its multi-mission next generation spacesuit, which my legacy client (now Collins Aerospace) bid and won in 2022. ¨ For Lockheed Martin, serving as Win Strategist and Proposal Manager for the USAF Range Standardization & Automation contract. Led Lockheed Martin’s winning proposal efforts resulting in a ten year multi-$100M CPAF \nDoug Tighe, PhD, CEng(UK), FIET(UK), 12 North Egremont Road, Alford, MA 01230 doug@tighe.org, 703-350-1108 cell \n  5 contract. Proposal was characterized by the customer’s Contracts Director in our post-award debrief as the “best proposal ever received” by the USAF’s Space & Missile Systems Center in Los Angeles. Proposal solution defined a phased COTS-based update to the USAF Spacelift Ranges at Vandenburg AFB and Cape Canaveral AFS. Following the win, I served as Lockheed Martin’s Program manager for the first three years of the contract. ¨ For BAE Systems, served as Capture Manager and Proposal Manager for the $2B Ares I Instrument Unit Avionics proposal to NASA. Ares was NASA’s initial concept for Space Shuttle replacement for human space launch. Led teaming efforts which resulted in an exclusive set of very strong subcontractors including- United Space Alliance, Harris, General Dynamics and Wyle Labs. Lost to Boeing based on a very low price – well below a level that BAE Systems’ management was willing to bid.

The agency IT environment was in really bad shape from desktop in-efficiencies wherein it took over 30 minutes for login, non-secure Internet connection, outdated Data Center, legacy mission applications needing modernization, sub-par cyber security environment including the IT personnel without leadership and a very low morale.   Kirit’s near, mid and long term IT modernization strategy along with strong leadership and the USITC management trust and confidence set the stage for achieving the set goals. While the modernization implementation was moving on schedule the US Congress passed a new Trade bill called the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) which was to build an end to end automated web Portal with congressionally mandated timeline. Kirit had to quickly redefine the IT modernization strategic plan by integrating the MTB Portal Service (MTBPS) end to end platform implementation.   Kirit’s total dedication and leadership resulted in successful roll out of the MTBPS platform which not only had high visibility but also political and economic exposure for some of the key US manufacturers. The agency got very high recognition from the House Ways and Means Committee. Kirit did not take his eyes off the Agency IT modernization efforts due to the MTBPS requirements and also successfully completed the modernization strategy as planned including a robust IT organization by implementing talent management methodology.  \n3 Kirit became a big advocate of the plight of small and independent Federal agencies which fly under the radar with lack of appropriate resources in terms of both adequate budgets and personnel expertise,   US\tDEPARTMENT\tOF\tHOUSING\tAND\tURBAN\tDEVELOPMENT\t(HUD)\t\t\t\tFeb\t2012-\tNov.\t2012\tChief\tTechnology\tand\tInnovation\tOfficer\tKirit\tprovided\tvaluable\tleadership\tand\tvision\tto\thelp\tHUD\tdefine\tits\t5\tyear\tIT\tTransformation\tinitiatives,\tHUDNET\tacquisition\tstrategy,\tshared\tservices\tstrategy\tand\timplementation,\tand\tcloud\tstrategy\tand\timplementation.\t\tHe\twas\tthe\tlead\ton\tOMB’s\tPortfolioStat\tmandate\tand\thas\tprovided\ttechnical\tand\tleadership\tguidance\ton\tthe\tImplementation\taction\tplans\tfor\tshared\tservices\ttargets.\tAs\tHUD’s\tlead\ton\tOMB’s\tDigital\tServices\tStrategy\tmandate\the\tcollaborated\twith\tvarious\tHUD\tstakeholders\tin\tidentifying\tand\ttransition\tplanning\tof\thigh-value\tcontent\tor\tdata\tsystems\tand\tservices\tfor\tcompliance\twith\topen\tweb\tAPI\tpolicy\tand\toptimization\tfor\tmobile\tuse.\t\tHe\twas\tresponsible\tfor\tDepartment’s\tsolution\tengineering\tdivision,\tleading\tthe\tplatform\tstandardization\teffort,\tenterprise\tstrategy\tfor\ttools,\tand\ttechnical\tvision\tfor\ttransformation\tinitiatives\tof\tcritical\tmission\tprograms\tsuch\tas\tPIH,\tNGMS\t&\tHousing/FHA.\t\tHe\twas\talso\tresponsible\tfor\t\tHUD’s\tnext\tgeneration\tIT\tInfrastructure\tServices\tacquisition\tplanning\tand\tmanagement\tprogram-\tthe\tHUDNET\tprogram.\tHUDNET\tis\ta\tmulti-vendor\tIT\tInfrastructure\tservices\tdelivery\tand\tmanagement\tframework\tdesigned\tto\tprovide\tthe\tfollowing\tobjectives:\t\t• Provide\tperformance-based,\tflexible\tcontracts\tto\tprovide,\tsecure,\thighly\treliable,\tand\tavailable\tIT\tinfrastructure\tservices\tthat\tmeet\tor\texceed\tOCIO\tcustomer\trequirements\tand\texpectations.\t\t• Continuously\treview,\tanalyze,\tand\ttake\tproactive\tmeasures\tto\tensure\tthat\tthe\tHUD\tIT\tinfrastructure\t stays\t current\t with\t technological\t advances\t in\t the\t industry,\t while\tvalidating\t that\t infrastructure\t investments\t are\t aligned\t with\t the\t HUD\t Strategic\t Plan,\tTransformation\tinitiatives\tand\tHUD\tmission\tobjectives.\t\t• Continuously\tmonitor\tcost\tof\tservices\tand\tcustomer\tsatisfaction\tfor\tservices\tdelivered\tthroughout\tthe\tlife\tcycle\tof\tthe\tHUDNET\tprogram\tas\tmeasured\tthrough\t3rd\tparty\tTotal\tCost\tof\tOwnership\t(TCO)\tstudies.\t• Establish\t continuous\t performance\t management\t monitoring\t and\t controls\t to\t provide\ttimely,\taccurate,\tand\tinsightful\tdata\ton\tprogram\tstatus\tand\tperformance\treporting.\t• Meet\tall\t the\t Federal\t mandates,\t compliance\t requirements\t regarding\t the\t IT\tinfrastructure\tservices\tand\toperations.\t\t\tThe\tHUDNET\tIT\tinfrastructure\tprogram\tcomponents\tinclude\tfive\tprimary\tservice\tdelivery\ttowers\t(Network\tTransport,\tData\tCenter,\tEnd\tUser,\tEmail\tto\tCloud\tand\teDiscovery),\tsupported\tby\ttwo\tservice\tmanagement\ttowers\t(Systems\tEngineering/PMO\tand\tAutomated\tMonitoring\tand\tManagement).\t\tKirit\twas\talso\tinstrumental\tin\tproviding\tHUD\twith\tits\tshared\tand\tcloud\tservices\tstrategy\tand\tvision.\tHe\tprovided\tvaluable\ttechnical\tvision\tand\texpertise\tin\tdefining\tHUD’s\tenterprise\twide\tplatform\tand\tData\tstandards\twith\tobjectives\tof\tachieving\toperational\tefficiency\tand\tlicense\tpricing\tconsolidation\tresulting\tin\tsignificant\tcost\tsavings\tto\tthe\tagency.\tKirit\twas\talso\tdesignated\tas\tthe\tHUD\tlead\tfor\tthe\tOMB\tmandates\tfor\tPortfolioStat\tand\tthe\tDigital\tStrategy.\tIn\tthis\tcritical\tand\thigh\tprofile\trole\the\tsuccessfully\tand\tcollaboratively\tworked\twith\tall\tthe\tHUD\tCXOs,\tthe\tProgram\texecutives\tand\tthe\tDepartment\tDeputy\t\n4 Secretary\tnot\tto\tmention\talso\tthe\tcollaboration\tand\tcommunication\twith\tother\tagency\tCXOs\tas\twell\tas\tthe\tFederal\tCIO/CTO\tand\ttheir\tstaff.\t\t  US\tDEPARTMENT\tOF\tCOMMERCE\t\t\t\t\t\tNov.\t2012-\tDec\t2014\tDeputy Chief Information Officer and Chief Technology Officer Kirit demonstrates an impressive leadership capacity and puts this capacity to work by demonstrating results throughout the Department.  He has had impressive results consulting, collaborating, and building partnerships with stakeholders, both internally and externally.  He has built strong relationships with the highest levels of management throughout DOC. Ha has also been successful in bringing OCIO stakeholders into discussions around IT planning, and has built stronger relationships with OMB and GAO.  He has built a culture of responsiveness and this has been evidenced by positive feedback from organizational leadership, the public, and internal and external customers.  The successful transition of several of Commerce’s operating units’ IT operations to the Departmental OCIO also demonstrated his talent at working across boundaries and at all organizational levels.  Of particular note was the unsolicited feedback received from the Undersecretary of the Economic Development Administration, complimenting Kirit's organization on a smooth transition of IT functions from EDA to OCIO. Kirit's innate ability to collaborate and elicit cooperation from his peers has led to greatly improved relationships between OCIO and the Office of Acquisition Management as well.  He has redirected efforts within OCIO to develop acquisition plans and strategies, and as a result of his extensive experience in both the public and private sectors, has brought an approach that embraces multi-faceted solutions involving financial, technical, and programmatic issues, as well as a strong foundation based on thorough requirements development.  Kirit’s approach to acquisition strategy has ensured that solutions are delivered on time and on budget, and that, most noticeably, the solution delivered fits the requirement being pursued. As the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and Deputy Chief Information Officer (DCIO), Kirit provided strategic leadership and vision to transform the Department’s mission accomplishment through the efficient and effective use of Information Technology.  His expertise was valuable in developing strategies for the use of “Big Data”, Cloud, and Mobility and is a thought leader in exploiting the intersection of these technologies as well as for the planning and execution of Department-wide IT initiatives relating to system architecture, networks, data center, application development etc. He was also responsible for providing tactical direction relating to emerging IT infrastructure systems and services.  Kirit led a Department-wide approach to vastly improve Commerce’s strategic IT planning by instituting a planning process that now provides a strong foundation for effective IT planning throughout the various diverse bureaus within the Department.  Kirit’s planning leadership reflected a logical progression from Departmental programmatic and management themes and goals, to individual objectives under those themes and goals, and identifies specific, time-phased initiatives planned to address those objectives.

This Request for Information requires responses by 5:00 PM EDT on August 25, 2025, submitted via email to the designated contracting officer, with CBP potentially requesting no-cost technical demonstrations from qualified vendors.\n\nThis procurement opportunity does not utilize any set-aside designations and is open to vendors of all sizes, though respondents must specifically note their organizational size status in submissions. No incumbent contractors or current service providers are identified in the available documentation. The proposed CAMS system must accommodate approximately 8,000-10,000 users across CBP's enterprise operations, supporting the management of 1,014,904 assets with a total value exceeding $8 billion. While specific contract values or budget ranges are not disclosed in this pre-solicitation phase, the scale suggests a substantial investment given the enterprise-wide scope and user base requirements. The timeline for implementation and service delivery periods will likely be determined through subsequent solicitation phases, as this RFI represents an information-gathering stage rather than a commitment to procurement.",

Vendors must respond to 98 distinct system requirements and provide detailed information across six areas including corporate information, solution description, training approach, support methodology, data analytics capabilities, and pricing details. This Request for Information requires responses by 5:00 PM EDT on August 25, 2025, submitted via email to the designated contracting officer, with CBP potentially requesting no-cost technical demonstrations from qualified vendors.\n\nThis procurement opportunity does not utilize any set-aside designations and is open to vendors of all sizes, though respondents must specifically note their organizational size status in submissions. No incumbent contractors or current service providers are identified in the available documentation. The proposed CAMS system must accommodate approximately 8,000-10,000 users across CBP's enterprise operations, supporting the management of 1,014,904 assets with a total value exceeding $8 billion. While specific contract values or budget ranges are not disclosed in this pre-solicitation phase, the scale suggests a substantial investment given the enterprise-wide scope and user base requirements. The timeline for implementation and service delivery periods will likely be determined through subsequent solicitation phases, as this RFI represents an information-gathering stage rather than a commitment to procurement.",

His expertise is heavily focused on configuration management and data management, which, although relevant, may not encompass the full scope of enterprise-wide asset lifecycle management systems or the specific procurement nuances CBP might prioritize. Additionally, his recent roles are more on the management and consulting side rather than hands-on system implementation or procurement strategy development.",

    "solicitation_summary": "U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is seeking an integrated enterprise-wide asset lifecycle management system called the CBP Asset Management System (CAMS) to replace 13 disparate systems currently managing over 1 million assets valued at more than $8 billion. The agency requires a comprehensive commercial off-the-shelf solution with open architecture principles that can provide improved asset accountability, tracking, and management capabilities across the complete acquisition lifecycle. The system must support six key operational scenarios including procurement, maintenance, reporting, compliance, financial management, and mission execution, with integration capabilities for existing financial and enterprise systems, mobile device functionality, and robust data analytics. Vendors must respond to 98 distinct system requirements and provide detailed information across six areas including corporate information, solution description, training approach, support methodology, data analytics capabilities, and pricing details. This Request for Information requires responses by 5:00 PM EDT on August 25, 2025, submitted via email to the designated contracting officer, with CBP potentially requesting no-cost technical demonstrations from qualified vendors.\n\nThis procurement opportunity does not utilize any set-aside designations and is open to vendors of all sizes, though respondents must specifically note their organizational size status in submissions. No incumbent contractors or current service providers are identified in the available documentation. The proposed CAMS system must accommodate approximately 8,000-10,000 users across CBP's enterprise operations, supporting the management of 1,014,904 assets with a total value exceeding $8 billion. While specific contract values or budget ranges are not disclosed in this pre-solicitation phase, the scale suggests a substantial investment given the enterprise-wide scope and user base requirements. The timeline for implementation and service delivery periods will likely be determined through subsequent solicitation phases, as this RFI represents an information-gathering stage rather than a commitment to procurement.",
